POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standard operating system interfaces based on the Unix operating system. 

It defines a standard interface and environment that can be used by an operating system to provide access to POSIX-compliant applications. 

The standard also defines a command interpreter (shell) and common utility programs. POSIX supports application portability at the source code level so applications can be built to run on any POSIX-compliant OS.
