gRPC can use [[protobuf]]s as both its Interface Definition Language (**IDL**) and as its underlying message interchange format. 

defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types

In gRPC, a [[client]] application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object.

On the server side, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls.

A gRPC **channel** provides a connection to a gRPC server on a specified host and port.
