A python package build tool takes a configuration file and the source code, and builds [[source distribution]] or a [[built distribution]], like a [[wheel]] or a [[binary distribution]].

Example of build tool - [[poetry]], setuptolols.

When installing from a [[source distribution]], [[pip]] invokes a build tool to build the wheel.

build tool is specified in the configuration file like [[pyproject.toml]]
