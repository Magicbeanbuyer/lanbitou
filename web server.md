A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts [[request]]s via [[HTTP]]. A [[user agent]], commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so
